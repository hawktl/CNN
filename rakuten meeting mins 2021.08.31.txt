1. project manamenet slides => PK Han
2. what's simulation tools => thermal 6 Sigma sim ET for thermal = forthozne
3. how long to prepare the proposal, how many people in this team
4. Intel experince
5. scheduel => PK Han
6. their solution has CPU card/IO card. the thing is 
7. Bright protoptye to production
8. done some ODM intel base product, => 
9. schedel base one something estimated.
10. EE => bmc/ 125100, two card desing, I/O => temeputre cirictiy, addiont work need be done => SI/ has been done. ME=> most of those beed done for production, and some modification. Thermal=>  
11. Intial is for Japan first, then golobally, lighting
12. Gary Styskal, PB, EMC you get part mumber, viability of part readness => 2wks for BOM setup, 2wks for simulation
13. ownship is by pegatron develpment team, for the end to end warrenty, JDM => onwer ship to production
14. put more resource to project, sepeartion I/O card to save time for few weeks
15. two I/O, one is e810/Mounnt bryce, the other is messazine card, 
16. FPGA => provide by Altisostar, + HW desing 
17. from factor, same mechnical/chassis
18. NDA with Intel/ multi-party NDA
19. condenfity level from Pega for end of OCT. DVT/PVT => 
20. OCT drop by Intel => no able to meet the schedule
21. what's happen in FXN? 
22. base desing/ CPLD come from Intel, BMC vender intel refernece BMC/BIOS, 
23. end OCT get power on board from Altiostar => April 
24. concept/ allgero, solid works. 
25. schematic is Mentor
26. FB card?
27. BMC/BIOS is from 3rd Part, reference platfrom base on our expeience
28. Gary/PK/
29. PK=> 技術
30. Gary => 材料/生產
31. kabliko => refernce desing for Rakuten
32. pkhan@altiostar.com
33. PK han in US in bostone office work on rakuten for technlogy, ngdu
34. Gary base altion bostone, management atlotion 
35. send the thermal simuaition tool name to PKHan, provide the simuaition tools 
36.
